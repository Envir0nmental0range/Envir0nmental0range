Problem Sets within this course. Helper files written by course staff may be included in repository but are not described below.

ps1.py - Exploration of knapsack style problems through implementation of a greedy algorithm and a brute force algorithm to determine miniumum number of journeys required to move animals of different weights from one location to another when transportation method is limited by weight for one journey. Finishes with comparison of the two different methods over varying numbers of trials.

ps2.py - Models the cleaniong of a rectangular room by given number of cleaning robots. Makes use of Object Oriented Programming to implement different robot behaviours (for example: random walk).  Compares the effectiveness of different numbers of different robots in a given room and plots comparison using pylab.

ps3.py - Models population of a virus inside an infected patient. Uses inheritance to efficiently model patients who are either treated or not treated with antivirals and to model how drug resistance can impact treatment. Plots results of simulations using pylab.

ps4.py - Uses linear regression to model temperature increases over time in the USA. Plots models and evaluates them against witheld data.
